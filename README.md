# Predicting the real estate prices

In this project I have created a model for predicting house prices from a set of features. 

Here I have analyzed the problem from collecting data, imported it to Jupyter notebook, looked for promising attributes, found out correlations, plotted graphs, created a pipeline, dealt with missing values,etc.
